# Eggs FM Frontend

Made with Svelte (and love)

## Developing

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server and click the link
npm run dev
```

Before making a PR or commiting new code, make sure to run the formatter and
make sure the build succeeds:

```sh
npm run format
npm run build
```

## Building

The backend server on the root of the project requires that the frontend be built:

```sh
npm run build
```
